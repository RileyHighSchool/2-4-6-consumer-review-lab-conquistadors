This is a review coming from someone who hasn’t played any other call of duty games or even gamed at all really but I really loved this! I got it because the campaign looked really good and it was! Interesting plot, great characters, unique missions. The game play was pretty short but again I’m thinking that’s just a call of duty thing since most people just like the multiplayer which is also great but the campaign was so much more engaging to me would love to have seen more of it. There are some little glitches that are annoying like getting stuck in people and guns not working but they resolve themselves pretty quickly. Overall I highly recommend!
